# Human Speech Emotion Recognition (HSER)

## Description

Human Speech Emotion Recognition (HSER) is an innovative tool for analyzing human emotions from audio. The software utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), to accurately predict emotions based on uploaded audio files. We use two datasets RAVDESS and TESS.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Emotion Recognition:** Utilizes powerful SVM algorithms to accurately detect emotions from audio files.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive interface allows users to easily upload audio files and receive emotion predictions.
- **Multiple Emotions:** Capable of recognizing a variety of emotions, including happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust.
- **Customization:** Offers customization options to fine-tune the emotion detection models to specific use cases.
- **High Efficiency:** Provides fast and efficient emotion prediction, making it suitable for various applications.
